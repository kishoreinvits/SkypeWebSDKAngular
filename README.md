# SkypeWebSDKAngular
An attempt to make a reusable Angular directive to use with [a Skype Web SDK (Currently in preview)](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/office/dn962133(v=office.16).aspx)

We wanted to showcase Lync presence and subscription capabilities in one of our angular App. This code sample uses aliases in ng-grid column and makes them skype contacts.

To make and element get presence capabilities, it needs and attribute named 'skype' and an attribute named 'skypeContactAlias' with alias value whose details needs to be subscribed to.
